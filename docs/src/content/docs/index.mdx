## What is Xray Checker?

Xray Checker serves as a bridge between your proxy servers and monitoring infrastructure by:

- Continuously testing proxy connections through Xray Core
- Providing Prometheus metrics for detailed monitoring
- Offering status endpoints for uptime monitoring
- Supporting automatic configuration updates from subscription URLs

Think of it as your proxy infrastructure's health monitor - constantly checking pulse, reporting vitals, and alerting you when something needs attention.
